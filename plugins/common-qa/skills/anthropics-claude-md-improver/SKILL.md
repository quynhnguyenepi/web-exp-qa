description: Audit and improve CLAUDE.md files in repositories. Use when user asks to check, audit, update, improve, or fix CLAUDE.md files. Scans for all CLAUDE.md files, evaluates quality against templates, outputs quality report, then makes targeted updates. Also use when the user mentions "CLAUDE.md maintenance" or "project memory optimization".

# CLAUDE.md Improver

Audit, evaluate, and improve CLAUDE.md files across a codebase to ensure Claude Code has optimal project context.

**This skill can write to CLAUDE.md files.** After presenting a quality report and getting user approval, it updates CLAUDE.md files with targeted improvements.

## When to Use

Invoke this skill when you need to:

- Audit an existing CLAUDE.md for quality and completeness
- Improve a CLAUDE.md that is sparse, outdated, or missing key sections
- Check quality score of CLAUDE.md files across a repository
- Onboard a repository by creating or bootstrapping a CLAUDE.md
- Evaluate monorepo CLAUDE.md coverage (root + package-level files)
- Verify CLAUDE.md reflects current codebase state after major refactors
- Compare CLAUDE.md against recommended templates

## Workflow Overview

```
Pre-Flight --> Discover Files --> Assess Quality --> Report --> Update (with approval)
```

## Execution Workflow

Follow these 5 sequential steps to audit and improve CLAUDE.md files:

### Step 0: Discovery

Find all CLAUDE.md files in the repository:

```bash
find . -name "CLAUDE.md" -o -name ".claude.md" -o -name ".claude.local.md" 2>/dev/null | head -50
```

**File Types & Locations:**

| Type | Location | Purpose |
|------|----------|---------|
| Project root | `./CLAUDE.md` | Primary project context (checked into git, shared with team) |
| Local overrides | `./.claude.local.md` | Personal/local settings (gitignored, not shared) |
| Global defaults | `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md` | User-wide defaults across all projects |
| Package-specific | `./packages/*/CLAUDE.md` | Module-level context in monorepos |
| Subdirectory | Any nested location | Feature/domain-specific context |

**Note:** Claude auto-discovers CLAUDE.md files in parent directories, making monorepo setups work automatically.

### Step 1: Quality Assessment

For each CLAUDE.md file, evaluate against quality criteria. See [references/quality-criteria.md](references/quality-criteria.md) for detailed rubrics.

**Quick Assessment Checklist:**

| Criterion | Weight | Check |
|-----------|--------|-------|
| Commands/workflows documented | High | Are build/test/deploy commands present? |
| Architecture clarity | High | Can Claude understand the codebase structure? |
| Non-obvious patterns | Medium | Are gotchas and quirks documented? |
| Conciseness | Medium | No verbose explanations or obvious info? |
| Currency | High | Does it reflect current codebase state? |
| Actionability | High | Are instructions executable, not vague? |

**Quality Scores:**
- **A (90-100)**: Comprehensive, current, actionable
- **B (70-89)**: Good coverage, minor gaps
- **C (50-69)**: Basic info, missing key sections
- **D (30-49)**: Sparse or outdated
- **F (0-29)**: Missing or severely outdated

### Step 2: Quality Report Output

**ALWAYS output the quality report BEFORE making any updates.**

Format:

```
## CLAUDE.md Quality Report

### Summary
- Files found: X
- Average score: X/100
- Files needing update: X

### File-by-File Assessment

#### 1. ./CLAUDE.md (Project Root)
**Score: XX/100 (Grade: X)**

| Criterion | Score | Notes |
|-----------|-------|-------|
| Commands/workflows | X/20 | ... |
| Architecture clarity | X/20 | ... |
| Non-obvious patterns | X/15 | ... |
| Conciseness | X/15 | ... |
| Currency | X/15 | ... |
| Actionability | X/15 | ... |

**Issues:**
- [List specific problems]

**Recommended additions:**
- [List what should be added]

#### 2. ./packages/api/CLAUDE.md (Package-specific)
...
```

### Step 3: Targeted Updates

After outputting the quality report, ask user for confirmation before updating.

**Update Guidelines (Critical):**

1. **Propose targeted additions only** - Focus on genuinely useful info:
   - Commands or workflows discovered during analysis
   - Gotchas or non-obvious patterns found in code
   - Package relationships that weren't clear
   - Testing approaches that work
   - Configuration quirks

2. **Keep it minimal** - Avoid:
   - Restating what's obvious from the code
   - Generic best practices already covered
   - One-off fixes unlikely to recur
   - Verbose explanations when a one-liner suffices

3. **Show diffs** - For each change, show:
   - Which CLAUDE.md file to update
   - The specific addition (as a diff or quoted block)
   - Brief explanation of why this helps future sessions

**Diff Format:**

```markdown
### Update: ./CLAUDE.md

**Why:** Build command was missing, causing confusion about how to run the project.

```diff
+ ## Quick Start
+
+ ```bash
+ npm install
+ npm run dev  # Start development server on port 3000
+ ```
```
```

### Step 4: Apply Updates

After user approval, apply changes using the Edit tool. Preserve existing content structure.
